Those frequenting the most popular Internet communities are likely to
read the phrase "I've lost my faith in humanity", in response to some
major or minor injustice wreaked some misguided soul.

The idea that one's entire faith could hang by some tenuous thread, finally
snapped by a single provocation is interesting. It speaks to some bleak
outlook on life that may informed by a certain pattern of Internet consumption
that broods on the sinister. But for every offense can be found redemption. 

Proof of true benevolence is often obscured by the cute, cuddly, or
cultural. 

* Something about how the Internet, like all media, accentuates the
  extremes
