# Intro

See the 
[first part of the guide]({% post_url 2014-01-23-quick-guide-to-writing-a-storybook-pt1 %}), and
the [previous as well]({% post_url 2014-01-27-quick-guide-to-writing-a-storybook-pt2 %}). In this
installment, I'll discuss some methods of producing art for the book,
reveal my first draft WIP, and discuss the refinement step.

# Process

1. <del>Pick a moral</del>
2. <del>Pick a theme</del>
3. <del>Layout the story</del>
4. <del>Storyboard the scenes</del>
5. <del>Flesh out the story</del>
6. Refine

# Producing Art

Before I discuss refinement, I'd like to digress from the main point of
these articles to briefly touch upon the topic of art. 

You don't need to be a skilled illustrator to create one of these story
books (I'm definitely not). There are alternatives to drawing the
scenes, including sourcing clipart and photos online (although there are
copyright you will want to investigate if creating something for
commercial purposes). You could also take photos yourself, arranging
scenes using dolls, action figures, and/or building blocks. 

If you do decide to draw the scenes, you have the choice of whether to
use a traditional or digital medium.

If you are not proficient with digital tools, you may want to scan art
youâ€™ve hand drawn. If you have some sort of tablet or touch device, you
might want to try a painted/pen art-style. For example there are many
free (and cheap) iOS applications such as 
[Brushes 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brushes-3/id545366251?mt=8), 
[Sketchbook Express](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketchbook-express-for-ipad/id410871280?mt=8)
and
[Paper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8), 
which may be used to create your drawings without a lot of
digital media experience.

If however you are experienced with digital media tools, you may want to
take extra consideration for your art style. Will you use your art for
another purpose? Will you want to reuse art? How important is time
versus style? For example, you could create your vector art in a way
that minimizes the total amount of content you need to create. 

# First WIP

As I created sketches and began to flesh out the artwork, I had to make
decisions affecting the consistency of the characters appearance and
some of the details of the art style. You'll notice that the drawings
are inconsistent in several places, and we'll discuss this more during
refinement. If we were experienced at doing this, we might be able to
work with fewer drafts, but I think the greatest way to get better
something is by practicing with incremental approvements. 

To get a better sense of the captions for each picture, I used Google
Presentation in [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com). You could use
any presentation software for a similar purpose, such as Keynote or
Microsoft PowerPoint.

# Refinement

Even though the storybook is starting to come together, there are a
number of problems. As mentioned above, the style of the drawings
differs based on the order in which they were drawn (see if you can
figure out in what order they were created). 

Another problem is that the text is a bit disconnected. This can be
solved easily by adding more scenes between the ones that feel
disconnected, but obviously requires more work. 

There are shortcuts taken with certain scenes. For example, on the page
where Moony is working with a puzzle, the tamborine and blocks have
gradient effects that don't mesh with the flat color of the other pages.
This is because these elements were sourced from 
[Open ClipArt](https://openclipart.org).

The backgrounds are either a mess or brilliant. Some are dark (like
space might be), some are bright (for no good reason), and all are just
geometric patterns. I had a tough time thinking of what should be in the
background!

Finally, Moony is not easily recognizable as the moon. Okay, so that is
not such a huge problem since the text helps out, but it's worth
considering. 

# Conclusion

I'll continue to work on this, and you should find a link to the raw
artwork and text on my [Github](https://github.com/jamiely) profile
soon. There are two important things that I think are useful to take
away from this series of articles. 

Firstly, that we can use a simple, straightforward, and procedural
framework to create something new and engaging. Secondly, that rather
than relying on great, masterful sweeps of innovation, we can
methodically works towards success via continous refinement.
