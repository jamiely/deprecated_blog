<p>Notes:</p>
<p>I go easy on cumin since Lisa doesn&rsquo;t like it. Also, I typically make Spanish rice too wet, so I&rsquo;m happy with how it turned out this time. The refried beans were a little too clumpy, and I wish I&rsquo;d saved some more of the juices. With the pico, I forgot the red onion! There are some recipes that I don&rsquo;t really refer to anymore, including guacamole and pico de gallo, and the ground beef for the tacos. The taco ground beef has garlic, onions, lean ground beef, cumin, chili powder, and salt.</p>
