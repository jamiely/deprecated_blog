<p>I omitted the bacon from the recipe and reduced the amount of rice flour batter used (to barely enough to bind everything, about &frac12; cup, and added some glutinous rice flour &frac14; cup). This was NOT enough and the cake is a little mushy! This is my second time making it, and the first time, the 2 cups listed in the recipe seemed like too much. Next time, I will be trying 1 &frac14; cups.</p>
