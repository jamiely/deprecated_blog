Each of the baked goods featured here were my first attempts ever. Not pictured are chocolate chip and walnut cookies, a taco night we had, and some egg sandwiches. It&rsquo;s also my first time making chocolate chip cookies from scratch, as well as the banana muffins shown.</p><p>The broccoli in the crispy orange beef I made was a little tough. I wanted to make sure they were flavorful so I added them in early into the sauce to cook, but I think this draws out the moisture and makes them chewy. The chive cakes I made were a grainy because I rushed them out of the steamer. It was going on 10PM or so and I wanted them in the fridge, but didn&rsquo;t give them enough time to cook.</p><p>I&rsquo;m especially proud of the Wonton Soup, which I think is starting to taste more and more authentic.</p><ul><li>Chicken Katsu and Crispy Orange Beef over brown rice (<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/crispy-orange-beef/">http://allrecipes.com/recipe/crispy-orange-beef/</a>)<br/></li><li>Pan-fried chive cakes (<a href="http://shesimmers.com/2012/05/pan-fried-chive-cakes">http://shesimmers.com/2012/05/pan-fried-chive-cakes</a>)</li><li>Turkey pepperoni, green pepper, mushroom, and onion pizza using home made pizza dough (<a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/pizza-dough-recipe.html">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/pizza-dough-recipe.html</a>)</li><li>Hotpot leftovers</li><li>Flatbread (<a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/homemade-flat-bread-recipe2.html">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/homemade-flat-bread-recipe2.html</a>)</li><li>Baguettes (<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/french-baguettes/">http://allrecipes.com/recipe/french-baguettes/</a>)</li><li>Wheat bread (<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-whole-wheat-bread/">http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-whole-wheat-bread/</a>)</li><li>Rye bread (<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/real-ny-jewish-rye-bread/">http://allrecipes.com/recipe/real-ny-jewish-rye-bread/</a>)</li><li>Turkey Wonton soup</li><li>Banana Muffins (<a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/banana-muffins-ii/">http://allrecipes.com/recipe/banana-muffins-ii/</a>)</li></ul>
