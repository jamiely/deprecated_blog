<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/tumblr_files/tumblr_n8k7qh6rru1tfq9jro1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>Right before I grilled the steak from the previous post, I ruined these spare ribs. As you can see, they are burnt like the charred victims of a nuclear fallout. I left them for less than 10 minutes and found them ablaze like sacked Rome.</p>
<p>I posted this as inspiration for those who &ldquo;can&rsquo;t cook.&rdquo; Sometimes, I can&rsquo;t cook either!</p>
