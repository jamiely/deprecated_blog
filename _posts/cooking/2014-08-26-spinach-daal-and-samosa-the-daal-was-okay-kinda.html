<p>The daal was okay, kinda reminds me of a southern sauteed spinach. When I first looked up the recipe, I actually was thinking of saag.Â </p>
<p>The samosa was good except that the top crease came undone during deep frying for a bunch of them. I realized I didn&rsquo;t apply water to those top creases!</p>
<p>I also omitted certain spices that I can&rsquo;t justify stocking (such as asafoetida, which I&rsquo;ve never even heard of).</p>
