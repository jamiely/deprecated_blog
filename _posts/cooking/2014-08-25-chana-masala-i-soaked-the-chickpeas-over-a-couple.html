<p>I soaked the chickpeas over a couple nights to use instead of canned, but I didn&rsquo;t realize I should cook them as well, so they were tougher than I would&rsquo;ve liked. Although the picture turned out similar to the picture in the recipe, I like a thicker sauce, so after this picture, I mixed in some heavy cream.</p>
