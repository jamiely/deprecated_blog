# Intro

Below, I'll discuss a framework for writing a storybook. As I
describe steps in the process, I'll participate as well. Why 
would you want to write a storybook? Perhaps as a nice gift 
for someone you love. What qualifications do I have for giving
advice? None at all!

# Process

1. Pick a moral
2. Pick a theme
3. Layout the story
4. Storyboard the scenes
5. Flesh out the story
6. Refine
7. Revise, Repeat

# Moral

Childrens stories don’t have to have a moral or message, but why not
throw one in? From time immemorial, stories have functioned not only to
communicate history, but to teach. You don’t have to pick a traditional
moral, such as “sharing is caring”, but you want to say
something--anything. 

I picked the moral "throwing food is bad" since my daughter has
issues keeping her food on the table.

# Theme

The theme can be very simple, based on something like an animal:
“snakes” or an object such as “stamps”. It is better to select something
that is concrete rather than abstract, for illustrative purposes. For
example, you could have a theme “Wednesdays” but not only is it
something which is abstract, there are not a lot of symbols
corresponding to Wednesday (Odin being the primary one). 

Since my daughter is fascinated with the moon, that's the theme I
picked.

# Layout

This may be the most difficult part. A simple way to start is to
visualize 3 scenes from the book. I first came across this technique
during a workshop by Pig Iron Theatre Company. Ideally, they are scenes
from the beginning, middle, and end. If this is too difficult, reverse
the order by starting to visualize scenes first. As you visualize a
scene, slot it into one of three categories: beginning, middle, and end.  

Here are some characteristics of scenes that are at the beginning:
scene-setting and captivating. Middle: climactic, engaging. End:
expository, resolutory, closing. 

To capture a scene you’ve visualized, don’t get too detailed. Start by
writing down 1 or 2 sentences (shorter is preferable) that capture the
main idea of the scene. 

If you have more than one scene in each category, you don’t have to
discard your others, but try to pick one primary scene in each category.
This allows you to bring the story into tighter focus. If there are
similar scenes, you should merge them together as simply as possible. Go
for scenes with the most poignancy, impact, entertainment, etc.

As you think of scenes, allow your sense of imagination and whimsy to go
rampant. Remember that with kid’s stories, you don’t have a lot of
borders relating to suspension of disbelief. 

Here are my scenes:

* Scene: The moon runs around the heavens. (Beginning)
* Scene: The moon throws its food out, which become stars. (Middle?)
* Scene: The moon goes hungry and stops speaking. (End)

# Storyboard

Layout the 3 scenes you created with rough shapes, blocking out areas
for characters, major scenery and props. Remember to keep in mind
entertainment, poignancy, and depth in your layout. Here’s a checklist
to help you layout:

* The scenes are laid out differently
* They are several layers to the composition (a background and
  foreground at least)
* There is a setting, including background, decor, things that would be
  in the scene
* The character is wearing something that makes sense
* The character is posed in the most dynamic pose for the scene
* If the character is looking at something, is it more dynamic if he
  holds it? Wields it? 
* The reader’s focus in drawn in towards the main character or prop.
* There are not too many items in the same ground as the character
* The lettering all occurs similary throughout each scenese (or is
  different for a purpose)
* The lettering does not obscure what is happening in the scene (unless
  purposeful)

Here is my storyboard:

* Center: The moon throws its food out, which become stars.
* Right: The moon goes hungry and stops speaking.

I'll discuss the remaining steps in the
framework, and show more of my WIP.
