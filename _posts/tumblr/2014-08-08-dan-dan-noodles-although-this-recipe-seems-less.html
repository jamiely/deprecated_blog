<p>Although this recipe seems less than authentic, the main thing I like is that it is one of the quickest recipes I know, and it tastes fairly close to what I expect. I substitute Chinese black vinegar with a mixture of balsamic and rice vinegar, described below. I also use home-made chili oil. The chili oil was a little too coconutty for me, so I&rsquo;d halve the amount of coconut oil and substitute more olive oil.</p>
