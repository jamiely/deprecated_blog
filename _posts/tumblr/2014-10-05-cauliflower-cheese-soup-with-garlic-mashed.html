<p>For the soup, I substituted regular potatoes for sweet potatoes, removed celery, and added mushrooms. Instead of making a roux to thicken the soup, I pureed the veggies, which I cooked in chicken broth. Then, I thinned the soup with milk and heavy cream. (Like a bisque.) I also added dried parsley.</p>
