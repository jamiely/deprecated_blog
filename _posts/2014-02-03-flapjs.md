Flappy Bird is the top Apple App Store app right now. Although the
mechanics are simple, it is fun and addicting. Since I had some time
this weekend, I decided to try to implement some of its mechanics. It
also gave me an opportunity to refresh some of my JavaScript and DOM
knowledge, since I haven't touched it for quite awhile. 

It is really bare bones, having implemented mostly just collision
generation and detection, simple rendering, and the basic physics
necessary. Although the code is fairly neat for several hours' work, it
could do with a generous refactoring and should not be considered
exemplary code, especially with respect to maintainability.
